# Curricula

Curricula is a small sample application intended to help manage learning
resources. It is built with React, Webpack, and Node.

The idea is that there are so many great learning resources available, and
that a structured approach may be worthwhile. Hopefully, this application will
enable the creation of a curated curriculum and a more efficient approach to
the learning process.

### Resources

- Books
- Courses
- Screencasts
- Talks
- Blog Posts
- Challenges
- Projects
- **Building**

### Scripts

- `npm run build`: Uses webpack to create a new `./build/bundle.js` file.
- `npm run start`: Starts the webpack dev server with the application running
                   at `http://localhost:8080/`.
- `npm run test`: Runs all tests. All none of them.
